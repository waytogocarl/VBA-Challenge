# VBA-Challenge
I included the source code provided by our Professor in a folder titled: Source_Code, it is in this repo: VBA-Challenge.
Also included in this repo are screenshots of the total_stock_volume and the functionality as well as screenshots of each quarter after running the recursive VBA script.
There are two textEdit files with the recursive VBA script and the nonrecursive VBA script.
I also included the Excel sheet I worked on.
